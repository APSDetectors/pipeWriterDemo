#make a sleep process that will keep pipe open for ever. need a read and write.
# pipe rules un linux:
# 1  if app opens pipe for reading, it blocks on fopen until some other process
# opens the pipe for writing.
#2  if app opens pipe for writing, it blocks on fopen until some other process opens
# it for reading.
# 3 if writing app closes pipe, the reader app exits.
# 4 if reading app closes pipe, writer exits.
# 5 any number of reader and writer processes can fopen the same pipe.
# 6, using sleep for read and writing the pipe, means the pipe stays open forever.
# other apps will not  block on fopen, or exit on pipe closing, becuase pipe never
# closes.
# 7 if reading process calls fread and no data is available, it blocks until 
# data is there.
# 8 pipe can only remain open if there is at least one writer AND one reader.

#below makes sure pipes remain open forever. pkill -f sleep to kill these procs.
