The Advanced Photon Source is a synchrotron light source that produces high-energy, high-brightness x-ray beams. The source is optimized to put large quantities of high-energy photons into a very small area in a very short time.

The x-ray beam is customized at each beamline to meet particular needs. With more than 60 beamlines already operational, and more under development, the APS offers an exceptionally broad range of experimental conditions at a single facility. It is also conveniently located at Argonne National Laboratory, 30 miles southwest of Chicago, Illinois, with two nearby airports offering many travel options.

Scientists from around the world come to the APS to conduct forefront basic and applied research in the fields of materials science; biological science; physics; chemistry; environmental, geophysical, and planetary science; and innovative x-ray instrumentation. To get an idea of the range of work currently being done at the APS, please see the Science & Education section.

The APS is one of several leading user facilities located at Argonne. These facilities, which include capabilities in nanoscience, electron microscopy, and high-performance computing, are also available to support your research, and many of the access procedures are shared with APS.
